2. **Treatments Section** – Two treatment cards with proper alignment  
3. **Transformations Section** – Four before/after cards in a single row  
4. **Why Choose Clove Dental** – Bullet points + aligned right image  
5. **Safety/Features Section** – Highlighted features with cards

Each section is styled to closely match the design’s spacing, typography, and layout.
